                    To make postbacks safe, you should verify the signature
                    received in the postback. This is an important feature for
                    you to make sure that the postback, which you use as a base
                    to reward your users, is coming from {AppENV.APP_NAME} and
                    is not fake. By checking the hash, you can be sure that the
                    postback was sent by us and that it is legit. The signature
                    parameter should match the MD5 of the subId transactionId
                    reward secretkey.
